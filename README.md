# Problematic Artwork Identification

The aim of this project is to identify artworks in the UK (particularly statues/sculptures) that depict people related to or involved in the slave trade.

The examples of the scripts used to perform the categorisation can be found in this [Jupyter Notebook](/problematic_artwork_identification.ipynb), which can also be run on [Google Colaborotory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rDizJQGeG-LtzI0OZmMCuxlJWiNpAJB2?usp=sharing).
